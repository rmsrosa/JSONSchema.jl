# JSONSchema.jl

Parse jsonschema to Julia composite types and, maybe, one day, the other way around.

## Examples

### Acme example from json-schema.org

The examples here were taken from [Getting Started Step-By-Step](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html#properties), from the [JSON Schema organization](https://json-schema.org), with the [BSD license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) (as well as [AFL - Academic Free License](https://opensource.org/licenses/AFL-3.0)); see [json-schema-org/json-schema-org.github.io](https://github.com/json-schema-org/json-schema-org.github.io).

### Beerjson

This is my main motivation for doing this. I would like to map all [beerjson](https://github.com/beerjson/beerjson) schema specification to julia types. This is an extensive and intricate schema, so a manual solution would be quite laborious. An aside motivation is in the spirit of open source collaboration, hoping this package, if it ever comes to conclusion, would be helpful to others.
